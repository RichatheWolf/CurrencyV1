# CurrencyV1


PMR: Currency Project: there was not too much difficulty in putting together this challenge project.
The only difficult part would be writing out/ copying so many similar lines of code and formatting them properly.
I learnt how to properly use the printf command as I had never learnt how to directly format the code from the print statement.
(Although printf was mentioned in the early stages of the module, the exact commands were not provided in the lesson.)
